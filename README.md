## Introduction
Most overhauls only focus on rebalancing the game. This one modifies the game to make more sense logically and be more like how I would want it. Logical fixes, dialogue changes, quest changes, and a Random Encounter system are most of what this mod focuses on. For example, Melissa not going back to Red Rock Canyon after completing her quest, 1st Recon not wearing their uniforms nor using scopes, or Benny just standing around if you attack the chairmen. This mod fixes those!
